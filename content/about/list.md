Half-Gray Open Licenses currently contains these licenses:

* [Simple Free License]({{< relref "/simple_free_license/_index.md" >}})
* [Simple Noncommercial License]({{< relref "/simple_noncommercial_license/_index.md" >}})
* [Hybrid Open License]({{< relref "/hybrid_open_license/_index.md" >}})

There is also the [Noncommercial-Free License]({{< relref "/noncommercial-free_license/_index.md" >}}) but it should not be used for your new work. (The Hybrid Open License is a better alternative.)
